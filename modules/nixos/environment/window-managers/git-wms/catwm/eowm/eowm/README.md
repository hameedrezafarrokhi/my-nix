============

This is a simple window manager that continues and develops the idea of catwm for learning purposes.

borders and padding, but still no UI  
new window pushes master to the top of the stack

Naming
------

it was vewy hard:
 * catwm - origin
 * kittywm - stupid
 * meowm - two m's
 * eowm - hmm, ok

And you also stumbled upon the expanded form of the name, which I spent one brain cell on


Why?!
